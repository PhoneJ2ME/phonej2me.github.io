      <p> As with most of the projects hosted on the java.net web site,
the bug submission tool for the phoneME project will be the
familiar <A HREF="https://phoneme.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</A> environment. Issue Tracker is based on
IssueZilla, which is the CollabNet Enterprise Edition variant of the
popular open source bug tracking system known as BugZilla. Issue
Tracker is a mature bug tracking system that is effectively used in
many other open source communities on java.net. <br>
      <br>

Excellent and extensive online help is available on the use of Issue
Tracker. Visit <A HREF="https://www.dev.java.net/scdocs/ProjectIssues#aboutIZ">https://www.dev.java.net/scdocs/ProjectIssues#aboutIZ</A> 
for more information about Issue Tracker. <br>
      <br>
However, the best long-term solution for bug tracking for this
community will be determined by a number of factors, including these: <br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <ul>
        <li>Ease of use </li>

        <li>Extensibility of the user interface to support evolving
community and
release process needs </li>
        <li>Richness of interface mechanisms to external
defect tracking systems<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <p>Issue Tracker might not meet all of these needs, so other bug
tracking
systems are being evaluated. Any changes to the issue tracking tool
will preserve community contributions to date and maintain ease of use
for the community.</p>

      <h3>Preventing Duplicate Bug Reports</h3>
<!--END SECTION HEADER *  THIS IS A GREEN BAR WITH WHITE TEXT   -->
<!--BEGIN * BODY TEXT -->
      <p>Due to the efforts to make JavaTM Platform, Micro Edition
(Java ME platform) source code components available to the open source
community as quickly as possible, the internal database of existing
Java ME technology bugs has not yet been migrated from the Sun internal
bug tracking systems into Issue Tracker. For this reason, Issue Tracker
will not show bugs contained in our internal defect tracking system.
After the evaluation of bug tracking tools is complete, internal bugs
and bugs submitted by the community up to that point might be migrated
into a new defect tracking system. <br>
      <br>
In the interim, bug reports related to open source Java ME platform
components will be available for browsing by the community using the
Bug Database interface of the Sun Developer Network (SDN) web site
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/index.jsp. <br>

      <br>
The SDN Bug Database search tool currently lists bug reports related to
Java ME technologies, including product categories such as K virtual
machine, the CLDC specification, and the Mobile Information Device
Profile (MIDP) reference implementation. The interface now includes
additional product categories related to the phoneME project. <br>
      <br>
Because it's important to avoid duplicate bugs whenever possible,
members of the Mobile &amp; Embedded Community are urged to
browse both Issue Tracker and the SDN Bug Database for duplicate bugs
before submitting bug reports. <br>
      <br>
When duplicate bugs are discovered, module owners will evaluate
progress of the duplicate bug in Sun's internal bug database. If the
bug is not in advanced stages of processing, it will be moved by a
module owner to Issue Tracker to cultivate community participation in
resolving it and the Sun internal bug report will be closed. Duplicate bugs that are very close to resolution in Sun's
internal bug database will be left there and the duplicate Issue Tracker submissions closed and marked as duplicates. Such bug reports can of course be
viewed at the <a HREF="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/index.jsp">http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/index.jsp</a> interface.

      <h3>Tracking Community-Submitted Bugs</h3>
<!--END SECTION HEADER *  THIS IS A GREEN BAR WITH WHITE TEXT   -->
<!--BEGIN * SECTION SUB-HEAD -->
      <p><!--BEGIN * BODY TEXT --> </p>
      <p>Despite these interim measures for browsing for duplicate
bugs, community contributions of bugs using Issue Tracker are welcomed
and encouraged.
      <br>
      <br>
Issue Tracker will be the focus of community contributions of issues
related to Java ME platform open source software components. Sun
engineers, contributors, and community members will collaborate using
Issue Tracker to develop and explore community interests and the
evolution of the software and generation of community releases.
      <br>
      <br>

Bugs submitted using the Issue Tracker tool are very important to
developing community knowledge and involvement. The issues submitted
there will be processed start to finish in the open source community
and not in Sun's internal systems. Please log bugs at the Issue
Tracker. It's the key to working as a community on concerns, problems,
suggestions, and contributions to open source Java ME technologies. </p>
