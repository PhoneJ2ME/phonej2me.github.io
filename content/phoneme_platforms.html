<h3><A NAME="phonemefeature">phoneME Feature Software Project</A></h3>

<p>
The phoneME Feature software project is an open source development effort 
addressing the market and technical requirements of &#8220;feature phone&#8221; 
devices. The majority of mobile phones in the world today (about 80%) are 
feature phones.  Devices of this type typically include a high-resolution screen, 
multiple forms of messaging (SMS, MMS, IM, Email), basic 2D and 3D gaming, a 
camera, music player, Internet browser, etc.  

<p>
Powering all this functionality is a core set of Java ME technologies known as CLDC 
(Connected Limited Device Configuration, or Java VM) and MIDP (Mobile Information 
Device Profile). CLDC and MIDP are the most widely adopted Java ME application 
platforms used in mobile phones today.  Layered on this base is a set of additional 
Java ME technologies often called &#8220;optional packages&#8221; that come in the 
form of JSRs (Java Specification Requests).  

<p>
The phoneME Feature software includes the latest milestone and in-development implementations 
of CLDC and MIDP, as well as implementations for a number of optional package JSRs.

<h3><A NAME="phonemeadvanced">phoneME Advanced Software Project</A></h3>

<p>
The phoneME Advanced software project is a development effort to enable an open source 
implementation addressing the technical needs of devices in the advanced phone segment 
of the market. Advanced mobile handsets have established a firm and rapidly growing 
position in the mobile handset landscape. These devices often include powerful 
operating systems and hardware architectures that provide numerous opportunities for 
technical innovation and differentiation. 
<p>
To properly utilize these capabilities mobile handset OEMs are looking towards CDC 
(Connected Device Configuration). The CDC architecture is well suited to leverage key 
high-level OS features such as memory management, process structure, linking, 
multi-tasking, etc. In addition to providing enhanced compatibility to and from 
implementations of Java SE, the architecture is highly portable and reduces the 
integration effort associated with a variety of application environments and 
middleware components.
