<p>Java Platform, Mobile Edition  (Java ME platform)  is the prevailing technology in the  mobile industry, with 1.2 billion mobile handsets deployed.</p>

<p>Downloadable applications and end-to-end solutions have fueled a robust economy for all the participants in the mobile value chain. Tools and resources to support the development and deployment of these devices have evolved rapidly along with the core technologies. Today, Java ME technology is used by more application developers than any other single technology in the mobile space.</p>    <p>The ubiquity and widespread deployment of Java ME technology has created 
      unparalleled opportunities for advancing the platform. With community participation 
      and the free flow of ideas and code, there is an opportunity to advance 
      the platform to a new level of sophistication, robustness, and quality for 
      the devices of tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Java Technology and Mobile Handsets</h3>

    <p>Java ME technology is essential for accelerating the deployment of rich 
      multimedia applications and web services on all future mobile devices. The 
      phoneME open source project provides a centralized forum for collaboration 
      on Java ME platform technologies, with the intent of rapidly advancing the 
      platform to support the next generation of applications and services. 
    <p>
</p><strong>Making Java ME Technology a First Class Citizen on Mobile Devices</strong>

<p>The goal of the phoneME project is to make Java ME technology integral to more 
      key applications on mobile devices. Java ME technology will serve as the 
      foundation for not only games, but for implementing core applications such 
      as address books and messaging, or even the mobile device user interface.</p>
    <p>This goal highlights several technology areas that should be advanced through 
      community efforts: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accessing phone functions <br>
        Location APIs, messaging, Bluetooth, PIM functionality, and graphics 
        acceleration are all examples of phone features that have been standardized 
        in the Java ME platform.&nbsp; The breadth of phone functionality exposed 
        by Java ME technology today supports a wide range of applications. The 
        community should continue the trend for new API's and abstractions to 
        allow access to phone functionality while it promotes porting existing 
        API's to an ever-expanding set of devices, widening the reach of Java 
        ME technology. In addition, there is opportunity for the community 
        to port existing API's to an ever-expanding set of devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Multitasking<br>
        Java ME technology has established the necessary facilities and client 
        infrastructure to allow multiple Java ME applications to run concurrently. 
        This technology spans the range from low-end devices with very limited 
        hardware and OS support, all the way to more capable devices with process-oriented 
        operating systems. Community contributions to exploit and advance this 
        technology to allow an ever richer user experience are encouraged. Multitasking 
        should become a way to seamlessly integrate native device user experience 
        with Java ME technology, allowing Java ME applications to run alongside 
        native applications with uniform look and feel. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
      <ul>
	  <li>Robustness<br>
        As more capable, concurrent Java ME applications are written, consumers 
        expect reliability and robustness -- the desire for a crash proof environment. 
        To that end, the community should advance the state of the art in 
        Java ME technology for inter-application isolation, reliable termination 
        of untrusted code and resource management. These technologies all contribute 
        to a robust, 24x7 environment of concurrent Java ME applications, giving 
        developers increased confidence in the expanded use of Java ME on mobile 
        devices. </p> </li> 
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Responsive start-up and execution<br>
        Increasing emphasis will be placed on application 
        start-up and responsive execution as the role of Java ME technology grows 
        within the mobile device platform.&nbsp; Community participation to improve 
        the performance of the Java ME platform virtual machines and libraries 
        in this area, including new JIT compiler optimizations, OS integration, 
        and use of hardware acceleration are planned. There are also opportunities for increased inter-application 
        memory and resource sharing.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

<strong>Integrating with Web 2.0 Technologies and Declarative UI</strong>
<p>The past few years have seen dramatic advances in Web technologies. 
  Markup-oriented UI description has become more prevalent and 
  capable, enabling a rich and compelling look. Scripting has 
  become widespread as a way to glue UI logic together and to 
  allow rapid application development. Web services have 
  become prevalent and easier to use; mashups integrate services for the creation of higher-level 
  applications.</p>
<p>The integration of rich markup-based UI, scripting, and web service access has resulted in compelling web-oriented content, commonly referred to as Web 2.0 technologies. With its ever-present deployment on more than a billion devices, its wide developer base, and its ever-evolving access to platform features,  the Java programming language offers  a unique way of taking advantage of these technologies. </p>

<p>Community participation, encompassing several areas of work, can provide the infrastructure to allow this integration to proceed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web rendering <br>
        This involves establishing modes of interaction between web content and 
        the Java programming language, defining how web content can invoke Java 
        APIs and how Java virtual machines can render web content. Included in 
        this work is an effort to provide lightweight rendering technology for 
        web content, spanning the range from XHTML and CSS to SVG. When this vision 
        is realized, it will be possible to incorporate web content seamlessly 
        inside a Java application. This includes the implementation of an ECMA 
        Script engine inside a Java virtual machine, sharing infrastructure between 
        the two. </li>
      <br>
  <li>Separation of UI from application logic<br>
        Web content is compelling because it establishes a healthy separation 
        between application logic and application UI. The separation allows application 
        UI to be replaced while retaining application logic. It also allows different 
        developer communities to come together to create rich applications. Graphics 
        and interaction designers can put together compelling content, programmers 
        can use Java ME technology to write application logic, and tooling conventions 
        bring the products of these communities together. Community participation 
        can make possible these integrated applications incorporating Java ME 
        and web technology.</li>

	<br>
  <li>Libraries for easy use of web services<br>
  The past few 
    years have seen an explosion in the number of web services from  providers such as eBay, Amazon, Google, and Yahoo. In addition, the use of services such as 
    deli.cio.us and Flickr have enabled individuals to produce compelling content and share it on the web. Lightweight Java ME technology libraries could allow developers easy access to web services for getting and publishing information without the need to master the plethora of XML-based technologies and 
    their resource-intensive implementations commonly used on 
    larger systems. The Java ME platform's local processing 
    capability, access to permanent storage, and phone 
    functions make it ideal for creating compelling applications 
    incorporating web services.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Improving Platform Consistency and Compatibility</strong></p>

<p>Key factors in the continued success of Java ME technology are consistency and compatibility across platform implementations. Developing applications and content in today's heterogeneous marketplace is a challenge. Developers 
  need a predictable and cohesive platform to rapidly and effectively create and deploy interesting 
  new content.</p>
<p>Driving such a consistent platform is significantly fostered by enabling 
  and encouraging all stakeholders in the industry to come together as a community 
  with a common vision. By collaborating on all parts of the technology, including 
  the platform software, tools, applications, and content, the community will 
  ensure the platform continues to evolve to meet the needs of all parties. 
  The goal is that this compelling cycle of innovation and collaboration will 
  lead to industry-wide adoption of a common implementation, thereby 
  making the Java ME platform and ecosystem more valuable for everybody.</p>

  
<p><strong>Bridging CDC- and CLDC-Based Technologies</strong></p>

<p>The past few years have seen the development of several Java ME technologies at a 
  breakneck pace. The community should establish the infrastructure and 
  architecture to allow applications written to these technologies 
  to co-exist and run in a uniform way. An example of this 
  diversity is the use of Java ME CLDC technology that forms the 
  basis for the MIDP profile, and the use of Java ME CDC 
  technology, with each presenting different approaches to key 
  platform features.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make the platform uniform<br>
    We intend to clarify and explain differences between CDC- and CLDC-oriented approaches to Java ME technology. We also intend to establish the architecture, best practices, and knowledge base to allow libraries to be written to run both in a CDC and a CLDC context.</li>

  <br>
  <li>Container architecture for abstraction <br>

  We are developing and would like to enhance technology to allow 
    current and future application models to run concurrently 
    on any given device. Our container technology abstracts 
    application model differences in lifecycle, security, and 
    runtime expectations. It prepares the Java    ME platform for execution of backwards-compatible technologies alongside new, cutting edge technologies in a 
    uniform fashion.</li>
</ul>
    <p>We hope you find our vision for the Java ME mobile platform exciting and will 
      join us in creating the most innovative and widely-deployed application 
      platform on the planet. Get involved - share your ideas, ask questions, 
      write code. What are the future applications that you want to enable for 
      mobile devices? To which devices would you like to port Java ME technology? 
      What new features would you like to add to the platform? Your active participation 
      is critical to the success of the Mobile &amp; Embedded Community.</p>
