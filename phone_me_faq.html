<h2><a name="ref7" id="ref7">Q: Can I claim that my distribution of phoneME software 
is Java or Java ME platform compliant or compatible?</a></h2>
<p> A: No. You cannot claim that, or refer to, any distribution of phoneME software 
as Java or Java ME platform compliant or compatible unless you have licensed the 
applicable Java ME Test Compatibility Kits (TCKs), have tested your distribution 
against the corresponding TCKs, and your distribution has passed the corresponding 
TCKs in accordance with the Java Community Process program.

<h2><a name="fair_use"></a>
Q: How can I describe a product I create using code from the phoneME open source 
site if I don't wish to get it certified by Sun?</h2>
<p>
If you create a derivative product from code you download from the phoneME community
project site, it is not considered "Java Compatible" until it is certified by 
a Sun-approved Test Compatibility Kit (TCK) test suite. Instead, it is considered a
"derivative work based on open source code from the phoneME Project." 
<p> 
Because "phoneME" is a trademark of Sun Microystems, and refers to an open source 
code base project, and is community sponsored by Sun for the benefit of the Java 
ecosystem, you can't call your implementation "phoneME" even if you don't change 
any code.  You could, however, say something like "phoneXYZ, based on code from the
phoneME project" or "phoneXYZ, a phoneME-based implementation."
<p>
Trademark law, however, does support a notion of "fair use" that allows the use of
a trademarked word as text under certain guidelines.  When making fair use of a 
Java or phoneME trademark, you should acknowledge that Sun Microsystems owns the 
trademark.  The following language is appropriate:
<p>
"Sun, Sun Microsystems, Java, and phoneME..... are trademarks or registered 
trademarks of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the U.S. or other countries."
<p>
For a comprehensive description of how and when you are allowed to use the Java
and phoneME trademarks, see the <a href="http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks">
Sun Trademark and Logo Usage Requirements</a> page.

<h2><a name="cldc1" id="cldc1">Q: What is phoneME Feature? </a></h2>
<p> A: phoneME Feature is an open source development effort addressing the 
market and technical requirements of mainstream mobile devices (“feature 
phones”). The phoneME Feature software includes Java ME Connected Limited 
Device Configuration (CLDC), Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP), as 
well as a number of optional package JSRs that incorporate a variety of 
key wireless industry standards and capabilities.

<h2><a name="cldc4" id="cldc4">Q: On what platform is phoneME Feature MR3 software 
available?</a></h2>
<p> A: phoneME Feature MR3 software supports development and deployment on the Windows x86 
platform, in emulation mode. For more information, see the 
<a href="https://phoneme.dev.java.net/content/phoneme_feature_r3.html">phoneME MR3 Software page</a>

<h2><a name="cldc5" id="cldc5">Q: What's the difference between phoneME Feature 
MR3 software and Sun's commercial product (CLDC HotSpot Implementation 2.1
and Sun Java Wireless Client 2.1)? </a></h2>
<p> A: Sun’s commercial products (CLDC HotSpot Implementation 2.1 and 
Sun Java Wireless Client 2.1) are built from the phoneME Feature MR3 
code base. However, there are some components included in the commercial 
code base that are not included in the open source code base because 
Sun does not have the necesssary rights to release them to the open 
source community. In addition, the licensing terms associated with Sun’s 
commercial product differ from those of the open source software. The 
phoneME Feature software is licensed under 
<a href="https://mobileandembedded.dev.java.net/content/license.txt">the 
GNU Public License, version 2</a>. Sun’s commercial products are licensed 
under a standard Sun commerical license.

<h2><a name="cldc6" id="cldc6">Q: How do I find out what features are planned 
for future releases of phoneME Feature software?</a></h2>
<p> A: Features and capabilities in future releases of phoneME Feature 
software will be determined based on market need and will be openly 
discussed and debated in the community. Final decisions on what gets 
incorporated into the code base will be determined by the Project Owner 
or PMC (as appropriate). For more details, please consult

<h2><a name="cdc1" id="cdc1">Q: What is phoneME Advanced MR1 software?</a></h2>
<p> A: phoneME Advanced is a development effort to enable an open source implementation 
of the Java ME platform addressing the technical needs of devices in the 
advanced phone segment of the market. The phoneME Advanced software is built 
around Java ME Connected Device Configuration (CDC) and incorporates implementations 
of a variety of key wireless industry standards. phoneME Advanced MR1 software 
represents the first milestone release of phoneME Advanced software in open 
source.

<P>

<hr size="1" noshade>
<h2><a name="cdc2" id="cdc2">Q: Will phoneME Advanced software be backwards-compatible 
with the Java technology implementation on existing phones?</a></h2>
<p> A: One of the goals of the phoneME Advanced software is to help ensure that
the application model used predominantly across today's mobile devices, 
Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP), is available and fully supported 
on advanced mobile phones. In addition, the phoneME project strives 
to deliver MIDP application compatibility across devices running either 
phoneME Advanced or phoneME Feature software.

<P>
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h2><a name="cdc3" id="cdc3">Q: I'm already using CLDC today, what more does phoneME 
Advanced software offer?</a></h2>
<p> A: The CDC architecture is well suited to leverage key high-level OS features 
such as memory management, process structure, linking, multi-tasking, etc. 
In addition to providing enhanced compatibility to and from implementations 
of Java SE technology, the architecture is highly portable and reduces the 
integration effort associated with a variety of application environments 
and middleware components.

<H3>Legal Notice</H3>
<P> The phoneME project will in FAQ, and other forms of notice on the website, 
make clear that open source licensees do not have the right to refer to 
any distribution of phoneME as Java, Java ME platform compliant or compatible 
unless they license the Java ME TCKs from Sun and test their implementation 
and pass the corresponding TCK in accordance with the Java platform compatibility 
model.
