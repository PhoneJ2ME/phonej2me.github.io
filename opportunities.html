  <p> The phoneME project offers several important benefits and opportunities for application developers.
<p>
First, phoneME reduces fragmentation. Developing the platform in the open, with contributions from the community, creates a more cohesive, robust, and reliable platform. For application developers, this translates into fewer builds, less testing, and more money. From this standpoint alone, application developers will benefit from a vibrant phoneME community.
<p>
Next, phoneME offers opportunities for creating more successful applications. It makes transparent the JavaTM Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME platform) stack that runs in a layer below your applications. In the past, calls to MIDP APIs or optional APIs were opaque, and developers had to rely on the specification to understand the behavior of the underlying platform. phoneME changes all that. Developers know that truth lies in source code. They can now examine and understand the behavior of the platform by looking at the phoneME source code.
<p>
Real-world applications are the place where the rubber meets the road for a Java ME platform stack. Application developers are well qualified to suggest performance optimizations or robustness improvements in API implementations. The phoneME project is the perfect place to interact with the architects and developers of the platform.
<p>
Application developers involved in phoneME will have the opportunity to drive the direction of the platform. Instead of platform architects deciding how to build the platform, the phoneME project will bring together experts from different areas of the ecosystem to create new directions for the platform. Application developers are an important part of this group.
<p>
Get involved today! Participating in phoneME helps keep the Java ME platform the perfect environment for applications developers to work.
